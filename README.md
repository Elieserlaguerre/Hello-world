# Hello-world
this is preparation to begin my journey of becoming a developer! 
this is something I've had on my to do list for a while now but have been putting it off until now! 
my name is Elieser laguerre, I'm 28 years old soon to be 29(november 6) and I want to start this new year with a new chapter in my life! 
I look forward to seeing what I will be capable of once I graduate from this course!
